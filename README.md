# Time_slider
Time_slider is basically an image sliding program which scrolls through a list of images from a specified directory.

The idea is to give a feel for the changes through time by scrolling through images that are captures on continious frames.

In layman terms it is just a slider that scroll through the images of a particulat directory.

Note: The main program is ttp_0.py and the other one is for testing it.
